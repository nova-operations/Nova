# Commit Message Best Practices

1. Use the imperative mood in the subject line (e.g., "Add feature" not "Added feature").
2. Limit the subject line to 50 characters.
3. Capitalize the subject line.
4. Do not end the subject line with a period.
5. Use a blank line between the subject and the body.
6. Use the body to explain **what** and **why** vs. **how**.

## Examples

- `feat: allow agent to create custom skills`
- `fix: resolve race condition in database connection`
